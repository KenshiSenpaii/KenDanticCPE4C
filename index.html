Witnessing the destruction of Khaenri'ah upon their arrival, the two attempt to flee, but they soon find their path blocked by a mysterious god who calls herself the "Sustainer of Heavenly Principles". She separates the twins, sealing the playable character away for five hundred years. When the sealed sibling, now called "The Traveler", wakes up, they meet a small fairy-like being named Paimon, who becomes their companion and travel guide. The two set off on a journey across Teyvat to gather information about their lost twin from each nation's ruling Archon.</p>

After barely escaping the Shogun's forces, The Traveler and Paimon join a band of separatists on Inazuma's Watatsumi Island before meeting Scaramouche, the Sixth Fatui Harbinger. Though he knocks The Traveler and Paimon unconscious, Yae Miko – the Shogun's familiar – grants him Raiden's Gnosis in exchange for their lives. With Miko's help, The Traveler battles and defeats the Shogun, and convinces her to repeal her restrictive policies. After returning to Liyue, the Traveler reunites with Dainsleif in The Chasm. The Traveler experiences a vision of their twin in Khaenri'ah, feeling torn between joining them and defeating the Abyss Order.

The Traveler eventually meets her human vessel, Nahida, within a dream, and discovers that the Akademiya's sages have partnered with Dottore, the Second Fatui Harbinger, to overthrow Kusanali and install Scaramouche as an artificial god.

            <p>The Traveler and Paimon journey to Fontaine to meet with Focalors, the Hydro Archon. They learn of the circulating prophecy that everyone in Fontaine except for the Hydro Archon would be washed away by waters. Upon their arrivial, they are greeted by the Archon's human vessel, Lady Furina. Later, Traveler and Paimon helped solve two cases, the first being a failed magic trick that targeted the twin Fatui magicians Lyney and Lynette and the other being a serial kidnapping case. Tartaglia, who is in Fontaine, gets accused of the kidnapping case but proven innocent by Chief Justice Neuvillette. However, the verdict-producing machine known as the Oratrice, declares Tartaglia guilty. As Tartaglia's arrest has caused a diplomatic problem between Fontaine and Snezhnaya, Fatui Harbinger Arlecchino arranges a discussion over the matter. Meanwhile, the Traveller and Paimon are sent to the Fortress of Meropide, an underwater place for convicts. They discover that a harmful substance, Primordial Seawater, has been released. The flood of Primordial Seawater was then prevented by Neuvilette. Furina's status as an Archon was also questioned, as Arlecchino reveals to the Traveler that she attacked Furina, intending to steal the Gnosis, but found nothing. Later, Neuvillette is revealed to be the current Dragon Sovereign of Water, successor to one of the original dragon rulers of Teyvat before the rise of the Archons.</p>
